Replication Project for the Course Gov 52 - May, 2021

Hello! My name is Daiana Lilo and I am a current undergraduate at Harvard University.
In this repository, you can find all the files and code needed for my replication project, the final project of the course Gov 52.

Included is the data, libraries, and Rmd file!

This is a replication of the analysis done in Harden and Kirkland (2016): "Do Campaign Donors Influence Polarization? Evidence 
from Public Financing in the American States"
